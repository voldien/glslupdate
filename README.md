# glslupdate #
--------

*glslupdate* is an old, simple library for allowing a glsl-shader retain its state after being relinked with a new shader. This is done by copy the uniform state of the shader and paste the uniform in succession of the shader has been relinked.

The library has not been *tested* since it was in development, which was about 3 years ago. The library will no longer be maintained.

The only dependence is the OpenGL library.
